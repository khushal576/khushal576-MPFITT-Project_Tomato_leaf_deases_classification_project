    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato Bacterial Spot is a plant disease caused by the bacterium <i>Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria</i>. 
        It affects tomato plants by causing small, water-soaked lesions to form on the leaves, stems, and sometimes fruit. 
        These lesions later turn brown and develop yellow halos, leading to defoliation and reduced fruit quality and yield.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it occur?</h2>
    <p>
        The bacterium responsible for Tomato Bacterial Spot thrives in warm, humid conditions. 
        It can enter tomato plants through natural openings or wounds, such as stomata or injuries caused by insects or cultural practices. 
        Once inside the plant, the bacterium multiplies and spreads, particularly during periods of high moisture.
    </p>

    <h2>Prevention:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plant Resistant Varieties: Choose tomato varieties that are resistant to bacterial spot if available in your area.</li>
        <li>Crop Rotation: Rotate tomatoes with unrelated crops to reduce the buildup of bacteria in the soil.</li>
        <li>Sanitation: Practice good garden hygiene by removing and disposing of infected plant debris promptly. Clean tools and equipment to prevent the spread of bacteria.</li>
        <li>Water Management: Avoid overhead watering, which can spread bacteria. Instead, use drip irrigation or water at the base of plants.</li>
        <li>Weed Control: Remove weeds that can harbor bacterial spot and serve as alternative hosts.</li>
        <li>Spacing: Plant tomatoes with adequate spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cure:</h2>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, once a plant is infected with Tomato Bacterial Spot, there is no cure. 
        However, there are steps you can take to manage the disease and reduce its impact:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prune Infected Parts: Remove and destroy infected leaves and stems to prevent further spread of the bacteria.</li>
        <li>Copper-based Sprays: Copper-based fungicides can help suppress the spread of bacterial spot. Apply according to label instructions, taking care not to exceed recommended concentrations to avoid phytotoxicity.</li>
        <li>Strengthen Plants: Maintain optimal growing conditions for tomatoes, including proper nutrition and watering, to help plants withstand disease pressure.</li>
        <li>Monitor and Scout: Regularly inspect tomato plants for symptoms of bacterial spot and take action promptly if detected to prevent further spread.</li>
    </ul>
