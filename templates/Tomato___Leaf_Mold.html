    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato Leaf Mold is a fungal disease caused by the fungus <i>Fulvia fulva</i>, also known as <i>Passalora fulva</i>. 
        It appears as yellow, white, or grayish patches on the upper surfaces of tomato leaves, often accompanied by fuzzy gray or brown mold growth on the underside. 
        This disease is more common in greenhouses or environments with high humidity and poor air circulation.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it occur?</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato Leaf Mold thrives in warm, humid conditions, particularly in environments where there is poor air circulation. 
        The fungus can spread rapidly under these conditions, especially when foliage remains wet for extended periods.
    </p>

    <h2>Prevention:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plant Resistant Varieties: Choose tomato varieties that are resistant to leaf mold if available in your area.</li>
        <li>Provide Adequate Air Circulation: Ensure proper spacing between tomato plants and prune regularly to improve airflow around the foliage.</li>
        <li>Reduce Leaf Wetness: Avoid overhead watering and irrigate early in the day to allow foliage to dry quickly.</li>
        <li>Apply Fungicides Preventatively: Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper before symptoms appear, especially during periods of high humidity.</li>
        <li>Remove Infected Leaves: Promptly remove and dispose of infected leaves to reduce the spread of spores.</li>
        <li>Keep Greenhouse Clean: If growing tomatoes in a greenhouse, maintain good sanitation practices to reduce the risk of disease spread.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment:</h2>
    <p>
        While there's no cure for Tomato Leaf Mold, you can take steps to manage the disease:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove Infected Leaves: Prune and remove infected leaves to prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
        <li>Apply Fungicides: Fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper can help manage leaf mold if applied early and regularly. Follow label instructions carefully.</li>
        <li>Improve Air Circulation: Proper spacing between plants and pruning to increase airflow can help reduce humidity and minimize fungal growth.</li>
        <li>Reduce Leaf Wetness: Avoid overhead watering and irrigate early in the day to allow foliage to dry quickly.</li>
        <li>Monitor Regularly: Regularly inspect tomato plants for signs of leaf mold and take prompt action if symptoms appear.</li>
    </ul>
