    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot is a fungal disease caused by the fungus <i>Septoria lycopersici</i>. 
        It appears as small, circular lesions with dark borders and tan or gray centers on the lower leaves of tomato plants. 
        Over time, the spots may enlarge and coalesce, leading to defoliation if severe.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it occur?</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly during periods of prolonged leaf wetness. 
        The fungus overwinters in infected plant debris and soil, and spores are spread by splashing water, wind, or contact with infected plant material.
    </p>

    <h2>Prevention:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plant Resistant Varieties: Choose tomato varieties that are resistant to Septoria leaf spot if available in your area.</li>
        <li>Crop Rotation: Rotate tomatoes with unrelated crops to reduce the buildup of fungal spores in the soil.</li>
        <li>Avoid Overhead Watering: Water the plants at the base to avoid wetting the foliage, which can help prevent the spread of spores.</li>
        <li>Remove Infected Plant Debris: Clean up and remove any infected plant debris from the garden to reduce the source of fungal spores.</li>
        <li>Apply Mulch: Mulching around the plants can help prevent soil splashback onto the foliage.</li>
        <li>Prune Lower Leaves: Remove lower leaves that may come into contact with the soil to reduce the risk of infection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment:</h2>
    <p>
        While there's no cure for Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot, you can take steps to manage the disease:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove Infected Leaves: Prune and remove infected leaves to prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
        <li>Apply Fungicides: Fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper can help manage Septoria leaf spot if applied early and regularly. Follow label instructions carefully.</li>
        <li>Improve Air Circulation: Proper spacing between plants and adequate ventilation can help reduce humidity and minimize fungal growth.</li>
        <li>Water Carefully: Avoid overhead watering and irrigate early in the day to allow foliage to dry quickly.</li>
        <li>Monitor Regularly: Regularly inspect tomato plants for signs of Septoria leaf spot and take prompt action if symptoms appear.</li>
    </ul>
