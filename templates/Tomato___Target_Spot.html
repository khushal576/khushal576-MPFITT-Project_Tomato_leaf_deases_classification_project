    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato Target Spot, also known as Corynespora Leaf Spot, is a fungal disease caused by the fungus <i>Corynespora cassiicola</i>. 
        It manifests as circular or irregularly shaped lesions on tomato leaves, initially appearing as small water-soaked spots that later develop into dark brown or black lesions with concentric rings. 
        Severe infections can lead to defoliation and reduced fruit yield.
    </p>

    <h2>Why does it occur?</h2>
    <p>
        Tomato Target Spot thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly during periods of high humidity or rainfall. 
        The fungus can overwinter in plant debris and soil, and spores are spread by wind, water, or contact with infected plant material.
    </p>

    <h2>Prevention:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plant Resistant Varieties: Choose tomato varieties that are resistant to target spot if available in your area.</li>
        <li>Crop Rotation: Rotate tomatoes with unrelated crops to reduce the buildup of fungal spores in the soil.</li>
        <li>Water Management: Avoid overhead watering, which can promote the spread of fungal spores. Instead, water at the base of plants.</li>
        <li>Remove Infected Plant Debris: Clean up and dispose of infected plant debris promptly to reduce the source of fungal spores.</li>
        <li>Improve Air Circulation: Proper spacing between plants and pruning to increase airflow can help reduce humidity and minimize fungal growth.</li>
        <li>Apply Fungicides Preventatively: Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper before symptoms appear, especially during periods of high disease pressure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment:</h2>
    <p>
        While there's no cure for Tomato Target Spot, you can take steps to manage the disease:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove Infected Leaves: Prune and remove infected leaves to prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
        <li>Apply Fungicides: Fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper can help manage target spot if applied early and regularly. Follow label instructions carefully.</li>
        <li>Improve Air Circulation: Proper spacing between plants and adequate ventilation can help reduce humidity and minimize fungal growth.</li>
        <li>Water Carefully: Avoid overhead watering and irrigate early in the day to allow foliage to dry quickly.</li>
        <li>Monitor Regularly: Regularly inspect tomato plants for signs of target spot and take prompt action if symptoms appear.</li>
    </ul>
